                   Welcome to Turbo Prolog!

This file contains last minute information since the manuals were
printed.  It also contains corrections to the manual, and a description
of all the files on the distribution disks.  Since this file contains
information important to you, please read it in its entirety; hopefully
it will answer any questions you may have.


                           NEED HELP?
                           ----------

If you have problems, please read this help file and the  Owner's
Handbook first.  If you still have a question and  need technical
assistance, help is available from the following sources:

1)  Type GO BOR100 on the CompuServe bulletin board system.
2)  Check with your local software dealer or user group.
3)  Write to: Borland International
              Turbo Prolog Technical Support

              Scotts Valley, CA  95066

4)  If you have an urgent problem that cannot wait, and you have sent in
the license agreement from the front of your manual, you may call the
Borland Technical Support department.

Please  have the following information ready before  calling  our
Technical Support department:

 1) Computer name,  model, and the names and model numbers of any
    additional hardware.
 2) Operating  system and version number (the version number  can
    be determined by typing VER at any DOS prompt).
 3) Contents of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 4) Contents of your CONFIG.SYS file.



             IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND LAST MINUTE CHANGES
             ---------------------------------------------


HARD DISK USERS
---------------
Use the following procedure if you will be installing Turbo Prolog on
a drive other than drive A:

1. Copy all Turbo Prolog files onto your hard disk.
2. Make sure that you are logged onto the directory where the Turbo
   Prolog files are located.
3. At the DOS prompt, type "INSTALL".
4. You are now ready to run Turbo Prolog!


NOTE TO TWO FLOPPY DISK USERS
-----------------------------
Once you have debugged your program and wish to make an .EXE, file it is
suggested that you do so in the following manner.

These files should be on the disk in drive A: PROLOG.EXE, PROLOG.SYS,
PROLOG.ERR (optional), PROLOG.HLP (optional), PLINK.BAT, and of course
the source to your program.

The following programs should be on the disk in drive B: PROLOG.LIB,
INIT.IBJ and the Linker.

Run Prolog from drive A: and set both the OBJ and Turbo directories to
B:\.  Now simply select .EXE in the Options pull-down menu and then
Compile.

If you still need more room on one of your disks, you can swap the
disk in drive A: after running Prolog with one containing only your
source code and PLINK.BAT (Once you run Prolog the entire development
system is resident).  Place only the required files on each disk to
allow enough room for larger programs.


IBM-CGA
-------
Turbo Prolog is shipped with IBM-CGA ON.  To accommodate systems
containing an IBM Color Graphics Adapter or any other adapter that
blinks or snows when the screen scrolls or is updated quickly.  If you
have a video adapter that does not blink or snow (such as a Hercules or
IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter) you will want to turn IBM-CGA "OFF". To
do so, select Miscellaneous settings from the Setup pull-down on the
main menu, then toggle IBM-CGA OFF.  This will also speed up screen I/O.


<F10>:End
---------
When you are editing in the auxiliary editor or creating a module list,
press <F10> (:End) to exit and save your work.  If you don't want to
save your work, Press <ESC> to leave both of these windows quickly.


TURTLE GRAPHICS
---------------
The predicates right and left are not supported with an o-flowpattern,
(as pointed out in the manual). Instead, a new predicate

     penpos(RowCoordinate,ColumnCoordinate,Direction)

is introduced. This predicate can be used in two ways.  If all
parameters are bound prior to calling penpos, the predicate sets the
position and direction of the turtle (and its pen).  If all parameters
are free, they will be bound to the values determined by the turtle's
current position.


HEX NOTATION
------------
Hex notation is supported.  A hex number is identified by a preceeding
dollar sign, $.  For example, $21 has the integer value 33.
Hexadecimals are not a new type; They are just another way to write
integers.


WARNINGS
--------
The warnings for unbound variables cannot be suppressed by <F10>, when
you are compiling to an object module.  To fix this, the corresponding
domain must be declared as a reference domain.


LINKER
------
Microsoft linker version 2.1 (or later) is required to link Prolog
object modules to the PROLOG library.


PROLOG.SYS
----------
Saving and loading .SYS files is done to and from the PRO directory.
This allows you to have a different .SYS file for every program you
develop.
